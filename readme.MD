What are routes?

Routes in node js, are operations that tell us about how to behave about client requests.

For eg, when client reqeuets something that does not exist, so we say 404.

Eg : CRUD operations, GET,POST,PUT,DELETE

HTTP Request : we handle them through numbers, 200 OK, 404 (not found),
